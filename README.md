# Avaruushyokkays (Space Invasion)

"""This is a Space Invaders Clone written in Python"""

For a competition within Evercom, I want the best adaptation of this game.

The RULES

ANY adaptation of the code MUST be commented with the reasons why

Any images used must be created by you

Any code snippets or modules used must be declared outside of the code 

You must have done the work yourself, this is written solely in Python.

Either clone or download, leave the file structure intact otherwise it will not run/build

£50 to the most original revision - £100 to a better adaptation of the code - maybe a 'Frogger Clone'

Prize only offered to Evercom Technology Limited employees in the UK
